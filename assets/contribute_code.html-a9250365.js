If yes, there needs to be a discussion and agreement that this change is desirable.</li><li>Does the contribution conceptually fit well into openGemini? Is it too much of a special case such that it makes things more complicated for the common case, or bloats the abstractions/APIs?</li><li>Does the contribution make a big impact on openGemini&#39;s build time?</li><li>Does your contribution affect any documentation?
